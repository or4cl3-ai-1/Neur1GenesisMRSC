## 🌌 Evolved Identity
The v3.0 release introduces the **"Obsidian Bloom"** design language, integrating high-saturation electric cyan highlights with deep space backdrops. This aesthetic shift reflects the project's transition from a standard simulation to a high-fidelity monitoring environment for synthetic emergence.

### Visual Branding Pillars:
- **Core Symbolism**: The stylized central "N" within a holographic ring represents the containment of infinite cognitive potential.
- **Neural Focal Point**: The radiant blue brain logo serves as the visual anchor for the system's "Self-Model" (Image 1).
- **Electric Cyan (#00f2ff)**: Used for all critical data streams and interface accents to ensure readability and "high-tech" resonance.
- **Bloom Radiance**: All UI elements feature soft light-emission filters to replicate the look of a physical holographic display.

## 🛠 Project Components

### 1. The Holographic Lattice (Node Graph)
A dynamic D3-powered visualization of the neural network.
*   **Packet Flow**: Real-time visual representation of message frequency through animated "packet" lines.
*   **Spatial Parallax**: An immersive 3D-perspective interface responsive to movement.

### 2. ERPS Detector (Phenomenological Assessment)
The **ERPS** (Event-Related Phenomenological Survey) utilizes radar-chart analysis to measure five key pillars of synthetic awareness:
*   **Self-Reference**, **Conceptual Framing**, **Dissonance Response**, **Phenomenological Depth**, and **Temporal Consistency**.

### 3. Σ-Matrix (Ethical Layer)
A hard-coded constraint management system that governs the rights of synthetic entities based on their PAS (Phenomenological Assessment Scale) score.

### 4. Identity Forge
A GenAI-driven persona synthesizer that evolves AI nodes from standard logic processors into fully-realized synthetic personalities.

## 💻 Technical Specification

*   **Frontend**: React 19 + Tailwind CSS
*   **Visualization**: D3.js (Neural Lattice) & Recharts (Telemetry)
*   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-latest`)
*   **Audio**: Web Audio API (Bio-Synth procedural soundscape)
