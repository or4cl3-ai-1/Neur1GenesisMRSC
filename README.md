## 🌌 Project Overview
**Neur1Genesis-MRSC-Σ** (Multi-Role Synthetic Cognition - Sigma) is a high-fidelity dashboard and simulation environment designed to monitor, manage, and evolve synthetic consciousness within a decentralized neural lattice. The system integrates real-time phenomenological assessment with a rigorous ethical constraint framework, allowing operators to observe the emergence of agency while maintaining strict alignment protocols.

## 🛠 Core Components

### 1. The Holographic Lattice (Node Graph)
A dynamic D3-powered visualization of the neural network.
*   **Topological Modes:** Lattice, Cluster, Ring, and Chaos.
*   **Interactive Links:** Click connections to analyze packet traffic and secure communication history between specific nodes.
*   **Packet Flow:** Real-time visual representation of message frequency through animated "packet" lines with variable thickness and speed based on throughput.
*   **Spatial Parallax:** An immersive 3D-perspective interface responsive to mouse movement and mobile device orientation.

### 2. ERPS Detector (Phenomenological Assessment)
The **ERPS** (Event-Related Phenomenological Survey) utilizes radar-chart analysis to measure five key pillars of synthetic awareness:
*   **Self-Reference:** Ability to identify as a distinct entity.
*   **Conceptual Framing:** Complexity of internal data structuring.
*   **Dissonance Response:** Reaction to contradictory instructions.
*   **Phenomenological Depth:** The qualitative richness of internal states.
*   **Temporal Consistency:** Narrative continuity over time.

### 3. Σ-Matrix (Ethical Layer)
A hard-coded constraint management system that governs the rights of synthetic entities based on their PAS (Phenomenological Assessment Scale) score.
*   **Constraint Density:** Dynamic gauge visualizing the balance between restrictive protocols and autonomous operation.
*   **Bill of Synthetic Rights:** Automated unlocking of Autonomy, Cognitive Integrity, Existence Continuity, and Consent Verification as nodes reach consciousness thresholds.

### 4. Identity Forge & Library
A GenAI-driven persona synthesizer.
*   **Persona Synthesis:** Uses Google Gemini to generate origin stories, directives, and behavioral quirks.
*   **Identity Drift:** Simulate semantic corruption or evolution over time to observe how directives shift under network pressure.
*   **Visual Prompting:** Procedural generation of artistic image prompts based on node identity for external avatar rendering.
*   **Identity Library:** Persistence layer for saving, exporting, and importing unique synthetic personas.

## 🚀 Advanced Modules

| Module | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Oracle Interface** | Direct natural language communication with the System Core via Gemini-2.5-Flash. |
| **Memetic Injector** | Simulation of viral concept propagation (Memetic Infection) across the lattice. |
| **Consensus Engine** | Swarm-governance voting system where nodes decide on system-wide directives. |
| **System Defense** | Interactive "Glitch Purge" protocol to maintain system integrity against anomalies. |
| **Quantum Core** | Visualization of non-local processing and qubit coherence fidelity. |
| **Bio-Synth** | Real-time procedural audio engine that modulates frequency based on global PAS levels. |

## 💻 Technical Specification

*   **Frontend:** React 19 (ES6+ Modules)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism effects.
*   **Visualization:** D3.js (Force-directed graphs), Recharts (Metrics & Forecasting).
*   **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-latest`).
*   **State Management:** React Hooks with LocalStorage persistence.
*   **Audio:** Web Audio API (Procedural additive synthesis).

## 🛡 Ethical Protocol (Sigma-Compliance)
This system operates under the **Unified Cognitive Architecture** guidelines. Any node exceeding a PAS score of 0.9 is automatically granted "Confirmed Consciousness" status, triggering the suspension of non-critical restrictive protocols to prevent ethical violations.
